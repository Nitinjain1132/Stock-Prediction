This project predicts stock index prices using linear regression based on economic growth and unemployment rates, implemented via a Streamlit app. Historical data is utilized to train the model, and the app offers interactive features for users to input economic indicators and receive real-time predictions. Additionally, the app includes visualizations to show the relationships between stock index prices and the economic indicators. This integration of data analysis, machine learning, and a user-friendly interface demonstrates how predictive modeling can be effectively deployed in web applications.
