Project Summary: Stock Index Prediction using Linear Regression with Streamlit
This project involves predicting the stock index price based on economic growth rate and unemployment rate using linear regression. The project is implemented using the Streamlit library, which provides a simple way to create web applications for machine learning projects. Below is a detailed summary of each component of the project.

1. Data Preparation
Dataset: A dictionary containing historical data of economic indicators and stock index prices.
Data Fields:
Year
Month
EconomicGrowth_Rate: The rate of economic growth.
Unemployment_Rate: The rate of unemployment.
Stock_Index_Price: The price of the stock index.
Dataframe: The dictionary is converted into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.
2. Feature Selection
The features (independent variables) selected for the prediction are EconomicGrowth_Rate and Unemployment_Rate.
The target (dependent variable) is Stock_Index_Price.
3. Linear Regression Model
Model Creation: An instance of LinearRegression from sklearn.linear_model is created.
Model Training: The model is trained using the selected features (EconomicGrowth_Rate and Unemployment_Rate) and the target (Stock_Index_Price).
4. Streamlit Application
Title and Layout: The Streamlit app displays a title, some spacing, and an image related to stock indices.
Data Visualization: Two scatter plots are generated to show the relationship between:
Stock Index Price and Economic Growth Rate
Stock Index Price and Unemployment Rate
5. Interactivity
User Inputs: The app provides input fields for the user to enter values for EconomicGrowth_Rate and Unemployment_Rate.
Prediction: Upon clicking the "Predict" button, the app predicts and displays the stock index price based on the input values using the trained linear regression model.
